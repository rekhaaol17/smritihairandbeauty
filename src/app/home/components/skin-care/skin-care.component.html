            <h2>Skin Care Solution</h2>
            <p>
              You may suspect you have dry, oily, or sensitive skin, but do you
              really know your skin type? Knowing your true skin type can help
              the next time youâ€™re in the cosmetics aisle.
            </p>

            <h3>Building a daily skin care routine</h3>
            <p>
              No matter what your skin type is, a daily skin care routine can
              help you maintain overall skin health and improve specific
              concerns like acne, scarring, and dark spots. A daily skin care
              routine has four basic steps you can do once in the morning and
              once before you sleep.
            </p>

            <!-- <h3>Process:</h3>
            <p>
              The skin is cleaned with a cleanser, post which an exfoliating
              scrub is used to remove dead skin. A steam treatment to extract
              whiteheads and blackheads followed by a moisturising massage
              completes the facial.
            </p>
